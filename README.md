## About the game

Gameplay in Space-Truckers is divided into three distinct phases: planning, driving, and scoring. 

In the planning phase, your simulated cargo container (a.k.a. your trailer) starts in orbit around one of the system's planets. 
The overall goal is to plan a course that will take the cargo pod to its' destination - or at least close enough to intersect the destination 
planet's retrieval systems, but you won't have the benefit of being able to make course changes once you've launched on your journey - say a prayer to 
Sir Isaac Newton, because it is the gravitational forces of the star and its' attendant planets that will bend and alter the ballistic path of your cargo post-launch!

Before launch though, you'll be able to specify the precise direction, force, and timing of your cargo so you can line up the perfect route. Better routes are ones that have a higher potential score. The potential score is determined by a number of factors, including the length of the route (longer routes have more opportunity to gain score, but risk losing even more points in time penalties), the amount of time in transit, average speed, and more. 

During planning, the simulation can be reset as many times as needed - that's why it's a simulation, after all! When you've launched on a successful route, you'll have the option to either accept the route or reset and try again. Accepting the route takes you to the next game phase, where you'll ride along with your cargo in your Space-Tractor, helping to nudge and guide it through a series of challenges encountered along the route. 

Once it's all said and done, your potential score will be displayed along with the actual score earned from the driving phase. Maybe you'll make the leaderboards someday!
